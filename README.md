radio
=====

A simple radio/music player using pygame libraries.

Requires Python and pygame (http://pygame.org) to run.

This script can play wav sound files (though mp3 and ogg could work, they are not yet officially supported). Simply place your files in a directory called 'music' where the script lives, and radio.py will play those songs at random until each song has been played once.
